This is my portfolio website. It was built from scratch and is simply made.
I have attached two css files, a style and reset sheets.
HTML is all simple but works on multiple devices with css flex elements
Resizing the page will move elements around to fit phone, tablets and desktop viewing.
The website has three sections, a header with a nav links to the about me section which has some information on myself. It also limks to the projects section and finally the footer with contact information.
Images are placeholders for future projects because right now I do not have any, the pictures link to google, W3 Schools and reddit until they are updated with links to projects.
The pictures are all the same but are all sized to different dimensions and the pictures themselfs are links. 
On the top of the HTML page I have some disabled code because I have a banner that is too big for my uses and will integrate into the website.
