This is my portfolio website. It was built from scratch and is simply made.
I have attached two css files, a style and reset sheets.
HTML is all simple but works on multiple devices with css flex elements
Resizing the page will move elements around to fit phone, tablets and desktop viewing.
The website has three sections, a header with a nav links to the about me section which has some information on myself. It also limks to the projects section and finally the footer with contact information.
Images are placeholders for future projects because right now I do not have any, the pictures link to google, W3 Schools and reddit until they are updated with links to projects.
The pictures are all the same but are all sized to different dimensions and the pictures themselfs are links. 
On the top of the HTML page I have some disabled code because I have a banner that is too big for my uses and will integrate into the website.


Updates
Some updates made to my portfolio website is adding bootstrap to make the website more polished. Still working on the color to use because it looks plain. I added three links to deployed applications.
1. ZenTen: Zenten is the first project that was a group project alongside Julia Davis, Isaac Luton, Revy Torres and myself. This application used bulma as the CSS framework and Javascript alsonside two APIs. The applicatin allows the user to select a time that they would like to relax and choose from 5 themes. It will then pull a random quote and image that will cycle after an interval time.

2. WorkDay Schedular: This application allows the user to save task in an hour slot and save onto local storage. This application uses local storage and moment.js to keep track of time of day and to save the text into a textbox. 

3. Password Generator: This application take input from the user to create a password from the user preferences. This is my first assignment that I was able to solve problems to make the application work. It is a simple program now but it is a reminder of how far I have come with all the technologies I have been learning.
